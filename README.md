# Area Sounds Whitelist
Mutes all area sounds except those specified in the config whitelist. Also mutes all ambient sounds, but these cannot
be whitelisted because it would be a big pain in the ass. If for some reason you really want to mute all area sounds 
except for certain ambient sounds, I encourage you to contribute to the plugin!
